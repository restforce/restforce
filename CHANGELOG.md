## 3.2.0 (Oct 9, 2019)

* Add support for the Batch API (@gaiottino, @teoulas)

## 3.0.0 (Aug 2, 2018)

* Escape record IDs passed in to the client to identify records to find, delete, etc. (@jmdx)

## 2.5.2 (Apr 3, 2017)

* Suppress [Hashie](https://github.com/intridea/hashie) warnings when using Hashie v3.5.0 or later (see [#295](https://github.com/restforce/restforce/pull/295) for details) (@janraasch)

* Add support for `upsert`ing using an ID (see the [Salesforce docs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_upsert.htm) for more details) (@ecbypi)
